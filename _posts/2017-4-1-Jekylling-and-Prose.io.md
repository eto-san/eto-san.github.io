## Setting Up Jekyll
I'm using [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for blogging and I'm quite excited at the simplicity that I'm experiencing with it. I was talking with another SecPro and he asked me what mattered to me within the security realm. I explained that in the technology complexity-creep, I wanted to see us consider the path forward with first asking what 'we can we simplify' before 'what can we *add*'. This is my actionable tribute to that idea. With Jekyll being a static site generator, I've (with the help of the creator) taken away the database and the cms...ahh, simplicity!

I found this Smashing Magazine [article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to be simply helpful.

## Editing Posts

So after you get setup you have to get familar with *how* you are going to edit your posts. The easiest way to make your first post is to go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0idtvxVo9I) was helpful in pointing on a quick start tool called [prose.io](http://prose.io). And then get familiar with markdown (an txt-html conversion tool  that, for our purposes is a plain text formatting syntax). This [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) was a perfect start for me to grap the syntax.
