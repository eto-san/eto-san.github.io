## h2 Setting Up Jekyll
I'm using Jekyll for blogging and I'm quite excited at the simplicity that I'm experiencing with it. I was talking with another person in the field of the security and he asked me what mattered to me within the security realm. I explained that in the technology complexity-creep, I wanted to see us consider the path forward with first asking what we can we simplify before what can we "add". This is my actionable tribute to that idea. With Jekyll being a static site generator, I've (with the help of the creator) taken away the database and the cms...ahh, simplicity!

I found this Smashing Magazine [article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) was simply helpful.

## h2 Editing Posts

So after you get setup you have to get familar with *how* you are going to edit your posts. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0idtvxVo9I) was helpful in pointing on a quick start tool called [prose.io](http://prose.io). And then get familiar with markdown. This [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) was perfect for me.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
